# Ayal Pierce Portfolio

A simple personal webpage created for Tufts University Web Programming Class. The "portfolio" contains a home page, a resume, and a short bio. 

All required aspects of assignment 1 were completed correctly, although the website is not well designed. 

I collaborated with stackoverflow on some details and got some general advice from TA Nick Teleky

I spent approximately 1 hour completing this assignment.
